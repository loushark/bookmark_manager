# bookmark_manager

As a user
So that I can choose a website
I would like to see a list of bookmarks

| class     | instances | methods  |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| user      | @username |          |
| bookmarks | @website  | list     |
|           |           |          |



### To set up the database
Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql

# Setting up test database

Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command
CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager_test;
Connect to the database using the pqsl command
\c bookmark_manager_test;
Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql

**Using TablePlus as GUI to manage databases**
